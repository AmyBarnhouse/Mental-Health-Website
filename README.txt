Summative Assignment: Mental Health and Wellbeing WebsiteFor my assignment, I have created a website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, aimed at students and young people who are seeking advice regarding their mental health.In order for the d3 visualisations to be properly visible, the website needs to be run on a local server. This to avoid CORS errors when my .csv dataset file is imported.
