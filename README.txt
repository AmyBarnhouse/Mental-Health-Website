Summative Assignment: Mental Health and Wellbeing Website
Github:https://github.com/AmyBarnhouse/Mental-Health-Website

For my assignment, I have created a website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, aimed at students and young people who are seeking advice regarding their mental health.

In order for the d3 visualisations to be properly visible, the website needs to be run on a web server(local or hosted). This to avoid CORS errors when my .csv dataset file is imported.
